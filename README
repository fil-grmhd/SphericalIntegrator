This thorn is a fork of Christian Reisswigs (reisswig@aei.mpg.de) SphericalSlice,
which itself is part of the Llama infrastructure.

It is meant to be an simplified generalization and replacement of SphericalSurface,
incorporating integration and decomposition on spherical or elliptic surfaces.
Additionally the storage and management of the spherical surfaces is parallelized.


TODO (?):
Synchronize only among those processors which are assigned for one sphere ->
create a MPI communicator for each slice.

Currently, interp-setup is forgotten whenever regridding occurs.
It would however be much wiser to check which spheres intersect moving grids
and forget about interpolation only about those.
